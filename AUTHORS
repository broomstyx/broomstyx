BROOMStyx is a parallel object-oriented software framework for 
solving nonlinear systems of partial differential equations that
allows for the combination of fundamentally different numerical
methods within a single code architecture. It was originally 
written by Juan Michael Sargado while he was a PhD student at the 
University of Bergen, Department of Mathematics from 2014 to 2019.
